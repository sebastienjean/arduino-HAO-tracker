This project is originally intended to be built using Eclipse IDE, 
and targets only Arduino Mega2560 platform.

Nevertheless, if you want to open the sketch and build it using Arduino IDE v1.0.x, 
you have to rename "HAO-Tracker" folder to "HaoTracker" (since Arduino IDE does not support)
- character in project folder name)
