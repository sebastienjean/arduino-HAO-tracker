This project is originally intended to be built using Eclipse IDE, 
and targets two different Arduino platforms (Uno and Mega2560).

Nevertheless, if you want to build it using Arduino IDE v1.0.x, 
you have to select the proper pinout definition file in "pins" folder 
(depending on your target board : MEGA2560 or UNO), and copy it in 
parent directory under the name "pins.h"
    
You will now be able to properly open and build the sketch
